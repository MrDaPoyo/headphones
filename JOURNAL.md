Today I started making my very own headphones! My goals are the following:
- Working Bluetooth headphones.
- Add a removable cable to them.
- Improve PCB design skills.
- Learn AutoDesk(r) Fusion 360.
- Hopefully, HOPEFULLY(!!!), add Active Noise Cancelling into them.
Amongst others.
I took the Sony WH-1000XM4s for reference while drafting a very basic 3D model of what they will look like. I could either go black and sleek, or perhaps a bit of black with some golden touches for the outer shell. This is going to be a whole challenge!

After a few hours of tinkering, I came up with a design I like for the earcups. This enables me to let me screw and unscrew the outer part of the cup with no problems.

After a while, I managed to make a hole! Turns out I had to use the "Combine"

I've been working for half an hour trying to find a design I'm comfortable with, and I think I found it! I decided to go with a Hesh ANC-ish design

I did yet another redesign :P. This time, I traced the Hesh ANC's earcup and then extruded and bevel-ed it. Afterwards, I retraced the inner part and extruded it so that there would be a segment for the ear cushions to fit on.
